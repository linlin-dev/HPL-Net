<!-- ## üìå Abstract
Scene graph generation (SGG) in satellite imagery (SAI) benefits promoting understanding of geospatial scenarios from perception to cognition. In SAI, objects exhibit great variations in scales and aspect ratios, and there exist rich relationships between objects (even between spatially disjoint objects), which makes it attractive to holistically conduct SGG in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) SAI. However, there lack such SGG datasets. Due to the complexity of large-size SAI, mining triplets <subject, relationship, object> heavily relies on long-range contextual reasoning. Consequently, SGG models designed for small-size natural imagery are not directly applicable to large-size SAI. This paper constructs a large-scale dataset for SGG in large-size VHR SAI with image sizes ranging from <b>512 √ó 768</b> to <b>27,860 √ó 31,096</b> pixels, named <b>STAR</b> (<b>S</b>cene graph genera<b>T</b>ion in l<b>A</b>rge-size satellite image<b>R</b>y), encompassing over <b>210K</b> objects and over <b>400K</b> triplets. To realize SGG in large-size SAI, we propose a context-aware cascade cognition (CAC) framework to understand SAI regarding object detection (OBD), pair pruning and relationship prediction for SGG. We also release a SAI-oriented SGG toolkit with about <b>30</b> OBD and <b>10</b> SGG methods which need further adaptation by our devised modules on our challenging STAR dataset. **The STAR dataset will be made publicly available at [STAR](https://linlin-dev.github.io/project/STAR.html)**. -->
